Exercise 1: Vibrational dynamics of methane</A>
</H1>

<P>
In today's exercises, we will learn how to perform basic MD using Qbox
and use the results to examine the vibrational modes of methane. 

<P>
The <code>~/QE-school/week2/day1</code> directory contains the files related to Qbox;
equivalent input files for cp.x can be found in the <code>cp</code> subdirectory.

<P>
Qbox and cp.x can run interactively and output to stdout, but it is usually
more useful to use an input script and redirect the output to a file.
Qbox uses an xml specification as the output file format; cp.x uses a
proprietary format similar to the output of pw.x. 
However, the output of both can be parsed to extract a trajectory file for the ions in 
the standard `xyz' format, which can be read by most visualization programs
(more on this later).

<P>
The general input syntax for the programs is:
<PRE>
 qbox [input-file] &gt; [output-file]
 cp.x &lt; [input-file] &gt; [output-file]
</PRE>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">
Ground-state energy of methane</A>
</H2>

<P>
We will begin by determining the ground-state energy of a molecule
of methane in a cubic box. Note that we are not running any dynamics yet.

<P>
Examine the file <code>ch4.sys</code>. This file contains the
specifications for the input configuration of the methane molecule. In
principle, one should first relax the ionic degrees of freedom to get the 
ground-state geometry, but for now, we'll take the approximate
positions listed here.
(For cp.x, this information is contained directly within the input file).

<P>
<PRE>
 (1)  # methane molecule
 (2)  set cell        16 0 0  0 16 0  0 0 16
 (3)  species carbon carbon_pbe.xml 
 (4)  species hydrogen hydrogen_pbe.xml 
 (5)  atom C    carbon       0.00000000   0.00000000   0.00000000

</PRE>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Line 1</DT>
<DD>The `#' is a comment ignored by <code>Qbox</code>.
</DD>
<DT>Line 2</DT>
<DD>Sets the cell parameters in units of Bohr (here, a 16 <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

three consecutive sets of triplets corresponding to the x,y, and z coordinates
of the three lattice vectors.
</DD>
<DT>Lines 3-4</DT>
<DD>Indicates the two species used in the simulation (C &amp; H) and
connects them to their pseudopotential files (<code>carbon_pbe.xml</code> &amp;
<code>hydrogen_pbe.xml)</code>.
</DD>
<DT>Lines 5-9</DT>
<DD>Lists the atom name, atom type, and atom coordinates in
Bohr. In Qbox, each atom requires a unique name (H1, H2, H3, H4); in
cp.x, one need specify only the atom type.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Now examine <code>gs.i</code>. This file contains the input specifications
that control the simulation.

<P>
<PRE>
 (1)  ch4.sys
 (2)  set ecut 35
 (3)  set xc PBE
 (4)  set wf_dyn PSDA
 (5)  set ecutprec 3
 (6)  randomize_wf
 (7)  run 0 50
 (8)  save ch4.xml
</PRE>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Line 1</DT>
<DD>This directs Qbox to first process the contents of the
<code>ch4.sys</code> file (if desired, we could have 
concatenated these two files into a single input file instead).
</DD>
<DT>Line 2</DT>
<DD>This sets the plane-wave cutoff in Ry. Required for all types of 
simulations.
</DD>
<DT>Line 3</DT>
<DD>This tells the code that your pseudopotentials use the PBE
exchange-correlation functional. Required for all types of simulations.
</DD>
<DT>Line 4</DT>
<DD>Sets the wavefunction dynamics. `PSDA' means steepest descent
with Anderson acceleration, which is a minimization scheme. Refer to the 
documentation for other options.
</DD>
<DT>Line 5</DT>
<DD>Sets the cutoff in Ry for the preconditioner. Only mess with this
if you know what you are doing.
</DD>
<DT>Line 6</DT>
<DD>Randomizes the electronic wavefunctions to give a starting
configuration for the minimization. Usually only makes sense for the initial 
electronic minimization at fixed ionic coordinates.
</DD>
<DT>Line 7</DT>
<DD>This is the meat of Qbox. If `run' is given with two
arguments, the first tells how many ionic (MD) timesteps to perform (none here,
since we are performing only an electronic relaxation); the second tells how
many electronic iterations to perform for each ionic step (50 in this example).
You'll be changing this throughout the exercise.
</DD>
<DT>Line 8</DT>
<DD>Saves the output state to a file (here, <code>ch4.xml</code>). This
will allow us to restart the simulation in the future (or start a new one
based on the final configuration of the current one). We will use this 
file as the starting point for our next simulation.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Run the code and output the result to <code>gs.r</code>:
<PRE>
  qbox gs.i &gt; gs.r
</PRE>

<P>
Look at the xml output. For each electronic iteration, look at the total 
energy, which is marked with the xml tag <code>&lt;etotal_int&gt;</code>.

<P>
Do this by direct examination, or type:

<P>
<PRE>
  grep 'etotal' gs.r
</PRE>

<P>
Note the energy convergence. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">
Dynamics of methane</A>
</H2>

<P>
Now we will stretch the bonds from their relaxed position and run dynamics on
the result.

<P>
First we need to run the electronic minimization on the the new stretched
configuration.

<P>
Copy the old <code>ch4.sys</code> into a new system file (e.g., <code>ch4_md.sys</code>). 
Now edit the positions, perturbing each of the bonds by about 5-10&amp; of their
bond length. Be sure you break the symmetry by mixing up the directions
and magnitudes of the perturbations; this way you will observe as many
vibrational modes as possible.

<P>
Edit <code>gs.i</code> so the system processes the new system file instead of the old
one. Run the result:

<P>
<PRE>
  qbox gs.i &gt; gs_md.r
</PRE>

<P>
Check the energy of this new configuration.

<P>
Now we want to generate a run that will load your saved state (with 
the electrons minimized) and run Born-Oppenheimer dynamics for 50 timesteps. 
We will use 5 electronic minimization steps for each ionic iteration, with a 
timestep of 10&nbsp;au. No need to set up a thermostat; we'll run in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">NVE</SPAN> 
ensemble for simplicity.

<P>
The input file for this step is <code>md.i</code>:
<PRE>
 (1) load ch4.xml
 (2) set ecutprec 3
 (3) set wf_dyn PSDA
 (4) set atoms_dyn SDA
 (5) set dt 10
 (6) run 50 5
</PRE>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Line 1</DT>
<DD>Loads the file <code>ch4.xml</code> to recover the exact state of the system,
in this case from the end of the previous step. Note that this will load all
accompanying initialization variables, so we don't need to reinitialize
everything.
</DD>
<DT>Line 2</DT>
<DD>Sets the cutoff for the preconditioner to 3 Ry.
</DD>
<DT>Line 3</DT>
<DD>Sets the wavefunction dynamics to PSDA, as before.
</DD>
<DT>Line 4</DT>
<DD>Sets the atom dynamics to SDA (steepest descent
minimization).
</DD>
<DT>Line 5</DT>
<DD>Sets the timestep for the dynamics (in atomic
units of 0.02419&nbsp;fs).
</DD>
<DT>Line 6</DT>
<DD>Runs 50 ionic MD steps, with 5 electronic
minimization iterations after each ion step.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Now run the dynamics:
<PRE>
  qbox md.i &gt; md.r
</PRE>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00023000000000000000">
Time dependence of energy and temperature</A>
</H2>

<P>
Once the dynamics are complete, plot the temperature of the system as a 
function of MD iteration using the <code>temp_ion.plt</code> script:
<PRE>
  ./temp_ion.plt md.r
</PRE>
In addition to plotting the constant of motion (red), the script performs
a linear regression (green) and gives the average value (blue) so the trends
are easier to see.

<P>
What is the physical interpretation of the temperature fluctuations (we will 
return to this later)?

<P>
Keep the temperature window open. We want to compare it to the evolution of the
potential energy. The script <code>econste.plt</code> plots the potential energy and
the constant of motion on the same plot to allow for direct comparison. Run it
by typing:
<PRE>
  ./etotal.plt md.r
</PRE>

<P>
Compare the time dependence of the potential energy (green curve) to the 
kinetic energy you calculated earlier. Do the results make sense?

<P>
Now compare the evolution of the constant of motion (COM) to that of the 
potential energy. Is the COM conserved as expected?

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00024000000000000000">
Simulating longer dynamics by running in parallel</A>
</H2>

<P>
Next we want to compute the vibrational modes of methane from the dynamics
simulation. To do so, we will need to run a much longer simulation.

<P>
You should have received a username and password for the Kraken supercomputer 
at the University of Tennessee. Since longer first-principles MD runs are
computationally intensive, we will be running the remainder of our simulations
on that machine and then transferring the results to the local machine for
visualization and analysis.

<P>
SSH to Kraken (don't forget the <code>-Y</code> flag):
<PRE>
  ssh -Y kraken-pwd.nics.tennessee.edu -l your_username
</PRE>

<P>
You should now be in your home directory. Run the following command:
<PRE>
  source /lustre/scratch/proj/qbox/icmr/qbox-setup-day1.sh
</PRE>

<P>
This will set up your account with the proper path and a copy of the input 
files. 

<P>
You will need to run all of your calculations directly on the luster parallel 
filesystem rather than the regular home directory. Accordingly, each user has 
a scratch space for runs. Change to your personal scratch directory within 
the luster filesystem by typing:
<PRE>
  cd /lustre/scratch/your_username/day1
</PRE>

<P>
The files in this directory should match the original distribution that you 
decompressed to your workstation. Note that there are
two additional files called <code>gs.job</code> and <code>md.job</code>. These are the job
submission files for the parallel scheduler. Choose one and examine its 
contents. When you generate new runs, you can use these as templates for 
creating corresponding job submission files.

<P>
The `size' parameter near the top tells the scheduler how many processors to 
allocate. This should be the same as the number following the <code>-n</code> flag 
in the final line. The maximum walltime is also given, along with a few other 
parameters that you shouldn't need to change. 

<P>
The actual command to run is given in the final line. If you use one of these
files as a template for a new run, you will need to edit the
name of the input and output file for Qbox.

<P>
In our case, we now want to simulate 400 timesteps of Born-Oppenheimer dynamics
of methane in order to collect enough data for our vibrational analysis. 

<P>
We need to start by replicating the ground-state electronic minimization
procedure for the methane with displaced coordinates (the same one you 
performed on your local workstation). On kraken, edit the file <code>ch4.sys</code>
and change the coordinates of the ions to match the displaced coordinates from 
the last run. 

<P>
Rerun the ground-state electronic minimization calculation, which is done by 
issuing the following command to schedule the <code>gs.job</code> job in the queue:
<PRE>
  qsub gs.job
</PRE>

<P>
You can check on the status of your job by typing:
<PRE>
  qstat -u your_username
</PRE>

<P>
Once the electronic minimization is complete, edit the file <code>md.i</code>. 
This is the same input file we used for the 
50-timestep MD run we did earlier. Change the coordinates of the
ions to match the displaced coordinates from the last run. Then change the 
`run' command to have the system perform 400 timesteps worth of dynamics rather
than 50. 

<P>
Run the new, longer simulation:
<PRE>
  qsub md.job
</PRE>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00025000000000000000">
Visualizing dynamics</A>
</H2>

<P>
The visualization software and analysis codes require inputs in `xyz' format,
so we first need to generate the xyz file. Return to your kraken account and 
use the <code>qbox_xyz.sh</code> script:
<PRE>
  qbox_xyz.sh md.r &gt; md.xyz
</PRE>

<P>
Use `scp' to copy over the xyz file to your local workstation. Open a new
window and type:
<PRE> 
  cd ~/QE-school/week2/day1
  scp your_username@kraken-pwd.nics.tennessee.edu:/lustre/scratch/your_username/day1/md.xyz .
</PRE>

<P>
Now launch XCrysDen on your local workstation by typing:
<PRE>
  xcrysden --xyz md.xyz
</PRE>

<P>
It will take some time, but eventually it should load all the coordinates as an 
animation. 

<P>
Cycle through the animation to see the vibrations of the C-H bonds. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00026000000000000000">
Analyzing vibrational modes</A>
</H2>

<P>
Now we want to extract the power spectrum from the
molecular vibrations. We can do this by performing a Fourier transform on the
velocity autocorrelation function (VAF). The VAF gives a normalized measure of 
the correlation between the velocity of an atom at one time and that same 
quantity later in the simulation. 

<P>
The program <code>vaf.x</code> generates the velocity autocorrelation function given
an xyz-formatted input file and writes the result to <code>vaf.dat</code>.  

<P>
Run <code>vaf.x</code> and follow the on-screen instructions. Start
your analysis at the first frame. 

<P>
The plotting program xmgrace offers a convenient way to perform a
discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Load the VAF file into xmgrace.
Now use the Fourier Transform function in the Data -&gt; Transformations menu. Set
the `Load result X' box to `Frequency' and look at the result for the DFT. You 
may have to rescale the plot to see the data (click on `AXY'). 

<P>
The time data in <code>vaf.dat</code> has units of picoseconds, which means
the Fourier transform will have frequency units of THz. 

<P>
Look at the peak locations. Can you reproduce the two dominant peaks in the 
IR spectrum here: <TT><A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="http://science.widener.edu/svb/ftir/ir_ch4.html">http://science.widener.edu/svb/ftir/ir_ch4.html</A></TT>?
Note that their results are given in cm<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
