Exercise 1: Analyzing MD runs--Melting of bulk silicon</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this exercise, we will explore some of the common analysis techniques for
MD simulations, using a melting simulation of bulk silicon as our test 
system.

<P>
Beyond visual identification of melting, we will examine the phase transition
using thermodynamic markers (change in the total internal energy) and
structural markers (the radial distribution function). We will also use two
dynamical quantities--the mean square displacement and the velocity
autocorrelation function--to observe the melting transition.

<P>
When performing calculations and comparisons, remember that both
Qbox and cp.x output data in Hartree atomic units.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000">
MD simulation of melting silicon</A>
</H2>

<P>
Given the computational expense of the simulations in today's exercises, we
will be using the Kraken supercomputer to generate the data. As before, we will
be using Qbox; however, equivalent input files for cp.x can be found in 
the <code>cp</code> subdirectory in today's tarball.

<P>
Log onto Kraken and set up your environment for Day 2 there:
<PRE>
  ssh -Y kraken-pwd.nics.tennessee.edu -l your_username
  source /lustre/scratch/proj/qbox/icmr/qbox-setup-day2.sh
  cd /lustre/scratch/your_username/day2
</PRE>
This will replicate the files you have on your workstation for today's
exercises.

<P>
On Kraken, examine the contents of <code>gs.i</code>. It contains the coordinates 
(in atomic units) for 64 atoms of bulk Si in a cubic box of dimension 
20.52&nbsp;Bohr. Key lines are annotated.

<P>
Run Qbox, using <code>gs.i</code> to generate the electronic ground state of 
the solid Si crystal. Remember that this is done by submitting a job file to
the queue:
<PRE>
  qsub gs.job
</PRE>
Note that by default, the script saves the final state in the file 
<code>si64.xml</code>.

<P>
Remember that you can check on the status of your running jobs by typing:
<PRE>
  qstat -u your_username
</PRE>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00011100000000000000">
Equilibration at 500&nbsp;K</A>
</H3>

<P>
Now we want to see what happens when we melt the crystal. In principle, one
could simply run a dynamics simulation at very high temperature by immediate 
coupling to a thermostat. However, having the system influenced too much by 
the thermostat without waiting for equipartitioning can generate unphysical 
dynamics. It is usually safer to raise the temperature slowly by first 
equilibrating the system at one or more intermediate temperatures.

<P>
We will run three successive dynamics simulations. First,
we will equilibrate the system in the solid phase at lower temperature 
(500&nbsp;K). Then we'll raise the temperature to 2500&nbsp;K--note that this is 
actually already <SPAN  CLASS="textit">above</SPAN> the experimental melting point--to create a
superheated solid. Finally, we'll raise the temperature to 3000&nbsp;K, generating a
strong thermodynamic driving force for melting.

<P>
Start by examining the file <code>md.i</code>. Notice that is reads the electronic
ground state we generated in the last step and runs Born-Oppenheimer dynamics  
for 750&nbsp;timesteps with <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="61" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\Delta t = 40$"></SPAN>&nbsp;au, or about 0.75&nbsp;ps total. 

<P>
Why can we use a much bigger timestep than we did for methane?

<P>
In contrast with yesterday's simulations, we are now running in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">NVT</SPAN>
ensemble. This requires coupling to a thermostat. Three lines in the input file 
control the thermostat:
<PRE>
set thermostat LOWE
set th_temp 500
set th_time 1500
</PRE>
The first of these directs Qbox to use the Lowe thermostat, which
involves a stochastic coupling to a heat bath. Other thermostat options can be
found in the documentation. The second line sets the temperature of the
thermostat in degrees Kelvin. The third line controls the frequency of
stochastic collisions with the heat bath, given in atomic units of time (the
inverse of the target frequency).

<P>
Run the simulation on Kraken at 500&nbsp;K for 0.75&nbsp;ps. Write the output to a file
<code>md_500.r</code> (remember that the job submission file <code>md.job</code> controls 
where the output goes). 

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00011200000000000000">
Equilibration of high-temperature solid at 2500&nbsp;K</A>
</H3>

<P>
Now we want to raise the temperature to generate a superheated solid.

<P>
Copy the simulation file <code>md.i</code> from the previous step into a new file.
Modify it to read the simulation output from the previous step at 500&nbsp;K and 
run another 0.75&nbsp;ps of dynamics on Kraken, this time at 2500&nbsp;K. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">It is important that you do not overwrite the output from
the previous run!</SPAN> Use an output filename <code>md_2500.r</code> instead. 
We will need all of the output files intact once we start the analysis.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00011300000000000000">
Melting transition at 3000&nbsp;K</A>
</H3>

<P>
Now that you have a well thermalized solid, increase the thermodynamic driving
force to melt the crystal by performing an additional 2&nbsp;ps worth of dynamics 
at 3000&nbsp;K. Start from the 2500&nbsp;K save file and write the output to a new file
<code>md_3000.r</code>.

<P>
You may start on the next sections while you wait for this run to finish.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00012000000000000000">
Temperature as a function of time</A>
</H2>

<P>
Once you have your data, plot the temperature as a function of time for each 
of the three simulations. Use the provided <code>temp_ion.plt</code> script on 
Kraken:
<PRE>
  temp_ion.plt md_500.r 
  temp_ion.plt md_2500.r 
  temp_ion.plt md_3000.r
</PRE>

<P>
Note the evolution of the temperature in each case. On average, how long 
is the system taking to thermalize? One can speed this up by starting from an
nonideal crystal or by tuning the time constant for the thermostat (although
one must be careful doing so).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00013000000000000000">
Potential energy and constant of motion as a function of time</A>
</H2>

<P>
Now we want to extract the total internal energy as a function of time for the 
two high-temperature simulations (2500&nbsp;K and 3000&nbsp;K). Use the provided 
<code>econste.plt</code> script:
<PRE>
  econste.plt md_2500.r 
  econste.plt md_3000.r
</PRE>
Note that in addition to the potential energy, the script also plots the
constant of motion.

<P>
Is the energy conserved in the simulations? Is this what you would expect?

<P>
Analyze the fluctuations and drift in the constant of motion. How does the
magnitude of the fluctuations in the constant of motion compare to that of the
potential energy?

<P>
For the 3000&nbsp;K simulation, get a [very] rough estimate of the latent heat of 
melting by comparing the energy at the beginning of the simulation (before the 
melt) to the energy at the end (after the melt).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00014000000000000000">
Visualization</A>
</H2>

<P>
Assuming your simulations completed successfully, you should now have data for
all three temperatures.

<P>
If (for some reason) your runs were unsuccessful, you can grab a copy of the 
outputs from the sample directory (on your local workstation):
<PRE>
cp ~brandonw/week2/day2/sample/md*.r .
</PRE>

<P>
All of the remaining analysis will be done on your local workstation on xyz 
files rather than on the direct output on Kraken. Generate xyz files on Kraken 
corresponding to each of your outputs:
<PRE>
  qbox_xyz.sh md_500.r &gt; md_500.xyz
  qbox_xyz.sh md_2500.r &gt; md_2500.xyz
  qbox_xyz.sh md_3000.r &gt; md_3000.xyz
</PRE>

<P>
Now copy these files to your local workstation. Open a new window on your
workstation and type:
<PRE> 
  cd ~/QE-school/week2/day2
  scp your_username@kraken-pwd.nics.tennessee.edu:/lustre/scratch/your_username/day2/md*.xyz .
</PRE>

<P>
Now that we have the xyz files, we want to visualize the melting directly.

<P>
There are dozens of visualization programs that can read xyz-formatted files. 
XCrysDen (<TT><A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="http://www.xcrysden.org">http://www.xcrysden.org</A></TT>), which you have already been using, 
is one of these.

<P>
Another excellent (and free) program is VMD, developed at UIUC 
(<TT><A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/">http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/</A></TT>).

<P>
Return to your local workstation and launch XCrysDen to visualize the dynamics 
at 500&nbsp;K:
<PRE>
  xcrysden --xyz md_500.xyz
</PRE>

<P>
It will take some time, but eventually it should load all the coordinates as an 
animation, which you can step through frame by frame using the `&gt;' button or
else cycle through continuously using the `&#187;' button.

<P>
Do the same for the 2500&nbsp;K and 3000&nbsp;K files. 

<P>
Visually compare the vibrational amplitudes at 500&nbsp;K and 2500&nbsp;K, then
convince yourself that the system melts in the 3000&nbsp;K simulation.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00015000000000000000">
Velocity distribution</A>
</H2>

<P>
A good thermostat should generate a distribution of velocity magnitudes during 
the run that reproduces Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. 
Confirm that this is the case for the Lowe thermostat we are using here. Use 
the code <code>vel_hist.x</code> to generate a histogram of the velocity magnitudes
for the simulation at 3000&nbsp;K. Type (on your local workstation):

<P>
<PRE>
  ./vel_hist.x
</PRE>

<P>
Follow the on-screen instructions. 
You will need to input the simulation temperature and the ion mass
in atomic mass units amu (not to be confused with the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">atomic unit of 
mass</SPAN>, which is the electron rest mass!) so the code can generate the proper
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for comparison purposes. To get the most
accurate value for the simulation temperature, look at the emphaverage value 
in the temperature plot. Use a velocity bin sampling width of 1e-6 atomic 
units. 

<P>
The output <code>vel_hist.dat</code> will have three columns. The first is the 
velocity bin in atomic units. The second is the normalized frequency that
speed is observed during the simulation. The third column gives the ideal 
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for your target temperature (for details, see
<TT><A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell-Boltzmann_distribution#Distribution_of_speeds">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell-Boltzmann_distribution#Distribution_of_speeds</A></TT>).

<P>
Plot both curves and compare the two (in xmgrace, load the data as type 
`NXY' to display both data sets at once).

<P>
Does your system follow MB statistics? 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00016000000000000000">
Mean squared displacement</A>
</H2>

<P>
One can obtain a lot of useful information about the diffusive behavior of the
system from mean squared displacements (MSD). They are calculated in the 
following way:
<BR><P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER" CLASS="mathdisplay">
<!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
\langle \vert \mathbf{r}(t)-\mathbf{r}(0)\vert^2 \rangle
\end{displaymath}

<IMG

 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
\langle \vert \mathbf{r}(t)-\mathbf{r}(0)\vert^2 \rangle
\end{displaymath}">
</DIV>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<P></P>

<P>
A solid will have a plateau value for the MSD that corresponds to the square of
the RMS amplitude of vibration. A liquid will have a linearly increasing MSD 
(can you think why?).

<P>
Calculate the mean squared displacement for the two high-temperature runs
(2500&nbsp;K and 3000&nbsp;K). Type:
<PRE>
  ./msd.x
</PRE>
Follow the on-screen instructions. You will need to input the simulation 
timestep <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$\Delta t$"></SPAN>. The results will output to <code>msd.dat</code>. Be sure to 
rename this file after each MSD calculation so it's not accidentally 
overwritten.

<P>
Plot the MSD for the two runs.

<P>
Do the trends match your expectations?

<P>
At 3000&nbsp;K, you should be able to clearly distinguish the liquid and solid
regimes from the slope of the MSD. How far into the simulation is the onset of 
melting (record the frame number)?

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00017000000000000000">
Radial distribution function</A>
</H2>

<P>
The radial pair distribution function <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$g(r)$"></SPAN> is a useful way of analyzing
structural changes in a crystal. It gives the relative probability of finding
an atom a particular distance away from another. Since it is normalized 
against the equivalent measure for a perfectly randomized system of identical 
size, the quantity is unitless. 

<P>
In a solid, the radial distribution function will consist of sharp peaks. As a
material melts, these peaks will broaden and some will disappear.

<P>
Generate the radial distribution function for all three of your simulations.
To do so, use the <code>rdf.x</code> code and follow the on-screen instructions. 
The code will create a file <code>rdf.dat</code> that contains <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$g(r)$"></SPAN>. The
code will overwrite any existent rdf.dat file each time it runs, so be sure to
rename the file each time. To run the code, type:

<P>
<PRE>
 ./rdf.x
</PRE>

<P>
For the first two solid simulations (500&nbsp;K and 2500&nbsp;K), start your analysis at
the first frame. For the 3000&nbsp;K simulation, choose as
the starting frame an iteration that is <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">safely</SPAN> within the liquid 
regime.  You should use the mean squared displacement to choose this range.
Note that you will also need to know the cubic lattice parameter for the 
simulation (20.52&nbsp;Bohr). For the grid spacing, use a value of 0.05&nbsp;Bohr.

<P>
Plot all three radial distribution function files using xmgrace or your 
favorite plotting program.

<P>
Which peaks disappear when the system melts? Why don't all of them go away?
