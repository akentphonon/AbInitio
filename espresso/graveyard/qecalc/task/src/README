A small set of Quantum Espresso launchers which can be currently used to 
check for convergence of such properties as total energy, lattice 
parameters and phonons with respect to energy cutoffs and number of 
k-points. Currently, to run an optimization one needs to create a python 
file (example is main.py) and edit it according to the task desired, 
provided the 'task' folder is in PYTHONPATH. One also needs to provide 
all the appropriate config files for Quantum Espresso (scf.in for total 
energy or geometry optimization; scf.in, ph.in and dynmat.in for 
phonons) and place config.ini into working dir. An example of config.ini 
is located in task directory. One only needs to specify the parameters 
needed for specific task. 

For now, QE config files should have one variable per line and no 
comments 

Before the run, make sure all the pseudopotentials from the config file 
are available and all the directories are created (e.g. temp/ ) and 
Quantum Espresso is in your PATH. See also example directory
