   - [DONE] Matdyn input parser: Should be able to import as a string anything which starts
     right after end of the input namelist.  (Important!)

   - [DONE] Extract header and attachment properly!

   - [NOT DONE !!!] Make sure there are no "" in input files. change " to '
   
   - [NOT DONE !!!] Should be able to switch off immediate parsing in QEInput
                    constructor. E.g. QEInput(filename, type='pw', parse = False)
