Proxy Echo Session
------------------

Description:
    Two daemons TaskMaster and Worker are running and listening on two different ports: 
    8100 (TaskMaster) and 8102 (Worker). Daemon Worker starts first, then TaskMaster
    which in turn connects to Worker. Client (telnet) connects to TaskMaster and
    sends message "Hello" to JobTracker. JobTracker appends message "JobTracker"
    sends it to TaskTracker. TaskTracker appends message "TaskTracker" and sends
    back to the JobTracker which in turns sends back to the client. So the returned
    message becomes: "Hello -> JobTracker -> TaskTracker -> JobTracker"

    Proxy Echo is similar to caseA except that the two daemons are started separately
    as application and are configured by taskmaster.cfg and worker.cfg. Both TaskMaster
    and Worker use twisted.application.service.MultiService (cool!)

Notes:
    JobTracker - protocol of the TaskMaster service
    TaskTracker - protocol of the Worker service


Revision: 1166

Home directory:
$ pwd
/home/dexity/danse-workspace/AbInitio/espresso/lab/hydra/usecases/cassandra


Set environments:
$ source envs.sh


Check what options we have so far. Actually, just two options: start and stop
(for each daemon separately)

$ cassandra
/home/dexity/danse-workspace/AbInitio/espresso/lab/hydra/usecases/cassandra/cassandra/bin/cassandra:  Must specify a command

Usage:    cassandra <command> [command options]
Options:
      --version
      --help     Display this help and exit.
Commands:
    start      Start taskmaster or worker daemons
    stop       Stop taskmaster or worker daemons


For example, if you want to start "TaskMaster" just type (don't do that now,
because we have automated script for that: start.sh and stop.sh):

$ cassandra start config/taskmaster

Starting TaskMaster and Worker daemons:
$ ./start.sh

Check if daemons are listening. We see that 8102 (Worker) has established connection
(with TaskMaster)
$ netstat -an | grep "8100\|8102"
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8100            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8102            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:8102          127.0.0.1:48708         ESTABLISHED
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:48708         127.0.0.1:8102          ESTABLISHED


Connect to TaskMaster and type some word. You see that the message passes through
JobTracker, then to TaskTracker, back to JobTracker and finally you get the message.

$ telnet localhost 8100
Trying ::1...
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Hello
Hello -> JobTracker -> TaskTracker -> JobTracker
Cool
Cool -> JobTracker -> TaskTracker -> JobTracker

Finally, we need to kill daemons:

$./stop.sh
cassandra process 18604 is dead
cassandra process 18607 is dead

Let's check the logs now:

We can do similar session on different machines. For this we need to change the
taskmaster.cfg and worker.cfg configuration files, set environmet and start
daemons separately. Start worker first:

[Machine A]
$ ./envs.sh
$ cassandra start config/worker

[Machine B]
$ ./envs.sh
$ cassandra start config/taskmaster

Important note: Make sure that port is not blocked by the firewall
