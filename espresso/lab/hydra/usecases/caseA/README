Use Case A: "Proxy Echo"
    Two daemons are running and listening on two different ports. Client (telnet)
    sends message "Hello" to JobTracker. JobTracker appends message "JobTracker"
    sends it to TaskTracker. TaskTracker appends message "TaskTracker" and sends
    back to the JobTracker which in turns sends back to the client. So the resultant
    message becomes: "Hello JobTracker TaskTracker JobTracker"

Components: telnet, JobTracker, TaskTracker
Complexity: basic
Schema:
[telnet] -> [JobTracker] -> [TaskTracker]
         <-              <-


Sample session:

1. Start JobTracker and TaskTracker daemons:

$ twistd -y driver.py

2. Connect to the JobTracker (proxy server) with a standard client (e.g. telnet),
type some text and click <Enter>

$ telnet localhost 8021
Trying ::1...
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Hi
Hi -> JobTracker -> TaskTracker -> JobTracker

3. Shut down daemons by killing the process, (make sure that twistd.pid is the local
directory)

$ kill `cat twistd.pid`
