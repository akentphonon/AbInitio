Use Case A: "Broken phone line"
    Two daemons are running listening on two different ports. Client (telnet)
    sends message "Hello" to JobTracker. JobTracker appends message "JobTracker"
    sends it to TaskTracker. TaskTracker appends message "TaskTracker" and sends
    back to the JobTracker which in turns sends back to the client. So the resultant
    message becomes: "Hello JobTracker TaskTracker JobTracker"

Components: telnet, JobTracker, TaskTracker
Complexity: basic
