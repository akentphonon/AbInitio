General Plan
============

1. Create web GUI for creation and editing of configurations (similar to PWgui)
2. Implement the following types of calculations:
    (Possible types of calculations: http://www.quantum-espresso.org/whatcanqedo.php)
    - PWscf (including "Total energy") (pw.x ['scf'])   
        + Total Energy          (pw.x)                  See: Example 1
        + Electron DOS          (pw.x -> dos.x)         See: Example 8
        + Electron Dispersion   ()                      See: Example ???
        ? Electron Bands
    - Geometry Optimization (pw.x calculation=vc-relax)
    - Single-Phonon         (pw.x -> ph.x -> dynmat.x)  See: Example 2
    - Multi-Phonon          (pw.x -> ph.x)
        + Multi-Phonon DOS        (pw.x -> ph.x -> q2r.x -> matdyn.x) See: Example 6
        + Multi-Phonon Dispersion (pw.x -> ph.x -> q2r.x -> matdyn.x) See: Example ???
3. Port these simulations to Octopod (Foxtrot)
4. Borrow Materials implementation from group (create and edit Material, import Material )
5. Add user authentication

Total Energy (Single Self-Consistent Run) (pw.x)

Multi-Phonon
