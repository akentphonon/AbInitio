Global Plan
===========

1. Create web GUI for creation and editing of configurations (similar to PWgui) ~ 4 days
2. Implement the following types of calculations:
    - PWscf (including "Total energy") + Electron DOS
    - Geomentry Optimization
    - Single-Phonon
    - Multi-Phonon + Phonon DOS
3. Port these simulations to Foxtrot
4. Borrow Materials implementation from group (create and edit Material, import Material )
5. Add user authentication
