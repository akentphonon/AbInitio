Vinil uses some javascripts from luban. So in order for vinil to properly work you need to go to "vinil/html/javascripts" and create symbolic links to luban and jquery javascripts:

	Luban/branches/include-opal/luban/weaver/web/jslib/luban
	Luban/branches/include-opal/luban/weaver/web/jslib/jquery

In my case it will look like:

	$ pwd
	/home/dexity/danse-workspace/AbInitio/espresso/vinil/html/javascripts
	$ ln -s /home/dexity/danse-workspace/luban/luban/weaver/web/jslib/jquery jquery
	$ ln -s /home/dexity/danse-workspace/luban/luban/weaver/web/jslib/luban luban
