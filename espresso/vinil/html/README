Vinil uses some javascripts and css from luban. So in order for vinil to properly work
you need to go to "vinil/html" and create symbolic links javascripts -> javascripts
css -> css:

	Luban/branches/include-opal/luban/weaver/web/jslib
	Luban/branches/include-opal/luban/weaver/web/css

In my case it will look like:

	$ pwd
	/home/dexity/danse-workspace/AbInitio/espresso/vinil/html
	$ ln -s /home/dexity/danse-workspace/luban/luban/weaver/web/javascripts javascripts
	$ ln -s /home/dexity/danse-workspace/luban/luban/weaver/web/css css

Note: Though 'jslib' is depricated and replaced by 'javascripts' but 'jslib' still
holds the latest changes (that are later on copied to 'javascripts') so I would
stick to 'jslib' for now.
