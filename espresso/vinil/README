General:
==============================================================
Vinil is a prototype application that runs simple Quantum Espresso simulation on
a desktop using pyre/luban. It uses the pw.x and dos.x to do electron simulation and plot electron DOS.
It can also plot phonon DOS based on presimulated phonon calculation (it doesn't
run any simulation though). Database data are pregenerated and cannot be modified from the
web interface.


Installation:
==============================================================

Requirements:
Python > 5.0
Apache > 2.0
PostgreSQL > 8.0
Matlotlib > 0.98 # For generating plots

0. Make sure you have Python, Apache and PostgreSQL installed.
1. Install pythia (pyre, opal)
2. Install luban (rev. 304)
3. Install Quantum Espresso (http://www.quantum-espresso.org/download.php )
4. Create database 'vinil' (no owner can be specified).
5. Populate database
6. Install vinil

Go to the root source directory.

Set environmental variables:

$ source deploy/dexity/dottools

For this purpose deploy/user directory is created as a template. Make sure to edit
 the variables according to your system settings and preferences.

Run setup script. Before you run it edit the script by setting the correct deployment directory.

$ ./setup.sh

Vinil application uses PosgreSQL database. So you need to create 'vinil' database first.
Then populate the database with data.

$ $EXPORT_ROOT/bin/initdb.py

Vinil uses Apache as a web server. You need to link the export directories to server
directories. You also need to have root privileges unless you have set public_html set up
in your home directory.

$ cd /var/www
$ sudo ln -s $EXPORT_ROOT/html vinil
$ cd /usr/lib/cgi-bin
$ sudo ln -s $EXPORT_ROOT/cgi-bin vinil

And you are done!

To enter the website enter URL:

http://localhost/cgi-bin/vinil/main.cgi

Configuration where the vinil application was successfully run:
OS:             Ubuntu 9.04
Python:         2.6.2
Quantum Espresso: 4.05
Apache:         2.2.11
PostgreSQL:     8.3.7
Psycopg2:       2.0.8
Matplotlib:     0.98.5.2

Notes:
- You might have different system so make sure to adjust settings accordingly.
- The current database contains just one table called "job" that holds three records:
one for electrons (pw), one for electron dos (dos), and the other - for phonons (ph).
These entries are populated when database is installed (initdb.py).
- Entries in the database are not created, modified or deleted.
- There is no journaling.
- There is no id generation.
- 'pseudo_dir' and 'outdir' in PW simulation, 'outdir' and 'fildos' in DOS simulation,
  'outdir' in PH simulation and are hardcoded (change in database will not have an effect)
