This is the testing implementation of job manager for remote jobs submission.
Instead of database configuration file will be used.

Installation instructions (draft)

Before you are able to use remote server or cluster you need to set properly your
environment. Make sure that you have account set up for the cluster and access the cluster
from the machine that has your private key stored. Specific settings will depend on the cluster.
Make sure to consult the cluster admin for the settings.

You need also set the EXPORT_ROOT to where the jobmanager is exported:

E.g.:
export EXPORT_ROOT=/home/dexity/exports/jobmanager

Server: foxtrot.danse.us
========================
In the .bashrc in your home directory you will need add the following lines:

[/home/<username>/.bashrc]
# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
       	. /etc/bashrc
fi
export BASH_ENV=${HOME}/.bashrc


In case if you don't have these lines added, to use util 'module' in your scripts you will
need to add the following lines:

[/home/<username>/path/to/your/script.sh]
#!/bin/bash
for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh; do
	if [ -r "$i" ]; then
		. $i
	fi
done
# rest of the script

Server: octopod.danse.us
