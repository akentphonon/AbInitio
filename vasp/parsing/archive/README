The parsing module parses the vasp input/outputs from calculations performed with the VASP package (http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/). 
It uses files taken from the P4VASP package (O. Dubay), distributed under GPL:
http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/odubay/p4vasp_site/news.php
The VASP program is not freely distributed and is not (nor any parts thereof) included in this software package.

Note: I think the _cp4vasp.so in the 'archive' directory is for 32-bit architectures...for now I just swap it with 
the one in this directory (which is for 64-bit arch's..will have to fix this soon)
